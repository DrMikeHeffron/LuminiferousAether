This repository contains a quick and dirty JavaScript program developed via https://editor.p5js.org/
for the purpose of calculating the fundamental constants of physics from the properties of the
luminiferous aether.
My book "The Luminiferous Aether: primary substance of the universe" (available from
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP8KTKPW) contains extensive background information.

All of this material is put here to support my presentation
(HowAetherProducesTheFundamentallConstantsOfPhysics.pdf) that explained how to calibrate the
properties of the luminiferous aether using NIST values and then compared the resulting
fundamental constants of physics to the values published by NIST with a level of confidence that
exceeds 6-sigma.

For those who prefer python, aether.py is roughly equivalent software that produces the aether.txt output.
